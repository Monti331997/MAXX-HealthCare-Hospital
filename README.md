Balance doctor workloads, improving staff efficiency and patient care quality.

Analyze bed occupancy to optimize space and plan future capacity expansion.

Track financial health with monthly billing insights, enabling better budgeting and insurance negotiations.

Understand patient trends over years to predict seasonal patterns and plan resources accordingly.
